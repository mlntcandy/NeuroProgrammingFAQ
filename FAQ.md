    Hello and welcome to the #programing channel!!!1!
    bc u are asking here, here are some things to note!


!!! description ""
    The Programming chat, despite it's name is the general tech channel.
    The channel description sums it up best; But another word phrase is:
    If your called a nerd or need the help of nerds. You are in the correct place.

    |-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | - Voice     | Whisper for vocal transcribing other people's voices                                   | For Vocal input, you can grab an LLM with audio input (source)                                                           |
    |             | ??? for TTS, Applio for RVC, search for RVC voices on a site like silly tavern         | No way that I'm aware of to train such.                                                                                  |

    | - LLM       | **TODO!** Ask around for rec based on VRAM, maybe 6GB, 12GB, 24GB                      | **TODO!** Same as left, but some finetuning advice.                                                                      |

    | - Vision    | **TODO!** Ask on this one                                                              | **TODO!** Ask on this side as well                                                                                       |

    |             |                                                                                        | having your LLM include vision is also an option.                                                                        |
    | - Memory    | **TODO!** Best we got is some sort of RAG.                                             | Intergrate some flavor of RAG into your LLM model. However you do so.                                                    |
    |             | Maybe memgpt or similar, I got no idea on this one.                                    | Long term, some database for memories.                                                                                   |
    | - API       | **TODO!** You really, really think this just exists? xdx                               | Not an AI question; check if a general project exists or hit the docs                                                    |
